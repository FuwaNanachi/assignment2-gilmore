I am a 22 year old college student, and while my major is Computer Science, I am currently working with a company in Japan to help me teach English there. I also do a lot of content creation, and love trying new things.

| Activity | Where can you do it? | How expensive is it? |
| ---| --- | ---: |
| HEMA | You can practice hema, or european sword play, just about anywhere. As for places to learn, you would just need to look up a dojo near you. | This can range from about $20 to well over $200, depending on how much you enjoy it |
| Gaming | Gaming can be done from anywhere, and houses all sorts of people | How much you spend, depends on how competitive you are, or how much you generally enjoy it. You should expect to spend at least 400 on a console. I personally spend well over 3000 on my PC |
| Dancing | Truly something you can do anywhere, as long as there's a beat and a will to dance | This one is completely free! Only thing you need to pay is your time, as learning can be very time consuming |
