## AppleBee's

Since it's not **exactly** a place to do much, when me and my friends go, we typically just sit in our booth and catch up. I don't **particularly** like the food, I just have a lot of fond memories of friends there.

## Airport Closest to AppleBee's

As for giving step by step directions, I can not do that. I can not, and have never driven, nor do I know almost any street name in Maryville. So, my guide would be to look up on Google maps, the shortest route to get to AppleBee's.

### Food I recommend

-Whiskey Burger
-Wings, on wing night
-Nachos, on wing night
